# RISC-V P Extension ALU Implementation in Chisel

## About RISC-V P Extension

The RISC-V P Extension is a specialised extension designed to enhance performance in DSP and multimedia applications. It introduces SIMD capabilities in a RISC-V processor, allowing parallel operations on packed data, significantly improving performance for tasks like image processing, audio encoding, and more.

## Overview

This project implements an **ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit)** for the **RISC-V P Extension** using the **Chisel hardware construction language**. The design focuses on **hardware reuse** and **modularity**, aligning with RISC-V's philosophy of efficiency and extensibility. The ALU supports various **SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data)** operations, enabling **parallel processing** of smaller data elements within 32-bit registers, making it suitable for **DSP (Digital Signal Processing)** and other performance-critical applications.

## Key Features

- **Modular Design**: Each functional block (adder, two's complement generator, MUX, and clip modules) is implemented as a reusable module, enhancing scalability and readability.
- **Hardware Reuse**: 
  - A **4x8-bit adder** is shared for both 8-bit and 16-bit operations.
  - A **2x1 multiplexer** handles all comparison, min-max, and absolute value operations.
  - A unified module is used for both signed and unsigned clip operations, optimizing area, readability, and efficiency.
- **Support for RISC-V P Extension**: Implements SIMD arithmetic, averaging, saturating, clipping, and comparison instructions for 8-bit and 16-bit data types.
- **Chisel Implementation**: Leverages the Chisel language to describe hardware at a high abstraction level while maintaining synthesisability.
