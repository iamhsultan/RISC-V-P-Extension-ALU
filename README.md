RISC-V P Extension
=======================
RISC-V technology involves the use of a base ISA and a set of custom extensions. The selection of these set of extensions depends on the underlying application for which the RISC-V processor is used. P is one of such extensions used for area and energy efficient implementation of DSP algorithms. 

P extension is used to operate on packed data. This means that data is organised into smaller units within a register. P stands for Packed SIMD operations. In SIMD operations, a single instruction operates on multiple data points simultaneously.
